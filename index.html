            <p>
                Lucky Dice is a simple game with a few rules. There are 2
                players playing alternately. Each round every player can only
                roll the die or hold the points he has already scored. The die's
                movement is completely random. There are two types of points -
                the real points and the current points. The real points cannot
                be lost, while the current ones can.
            </p>
            <p>
                If the player decides to roll the die and it falls on its face
                with only one dot, the player losses all it's current points. So
                the player's score will consist only in his/her real points (the
                ones the player decided to hold every round).
            </p>
            <p>
                The goal is to reach 100 points. The first player to reach this
                goal wins the game.
